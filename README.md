Updated by 2021/12/21 23:02 : Today is my big day the reason is that I can learn my liked orientation study! I desided to update this repo every day to record my daily learning!

Today I leart the implementation of anchor box by watching MuLi's corse in bilibili. In addition to reading orignal paper of "Faster RCNN", I have finished Course 2 + week1's
